R Data Analysis
==========

This folder is for the actual workflow for grabbing trees and traits and generating desired output, without using the online interactive aRbor environment.

Important tasks include:
-Importing trees from the user's computer or from OpenTree into the R environment
-Importing trait data from the user's computer or from online databases into the R environment
-Using trees and trait data to carry out a variety of tasks, like calculating phylogenetic signal, or doing PIC, etc.

Some of this code can be cannibalized from aRbor or other packages.
