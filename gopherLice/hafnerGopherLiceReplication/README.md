Gopher-Lice Interactions
==========

The matrix Hafner_interaction describes which lice (columns) parasitize which pocket gophers (rows). This information is drawn from:

Mark S. Hafner, Philip D. Sudman, Francis X. Villablanca, Theresa A. Spradling, James W. Demastes, Steven A. Nadler. (1994). "Disparate Rates of Molecular Evolution in Cospeciating Hosts and Parasites." Science 265: 1087-1090.

The phylogeny of pocket gophers is taken from the Open Tree of Life (accessed Sept. 17, 2014), though it is similar to the one from Hafner et al. 1994. The phylogeny of lice was not properly resolved in OpenTree, so it was also taken from Hafner et al. 1994.

The aim is to be able to replicate figure 2A from the paper, which shows the coevolution of the host-parasite pairs.
