Gophers and their lice
==========

Cospeciation analysis of gophers and their lice.

The data includes two phylogenetic trees (gophers: Gophers.phy, lice: Lice.phy) and a matrix specifying the interactions among species (GopherLice_HafnerMatrix.csv).

There's also Gophers_OpenTree.phy, which is the phylogeny of gophers that were included Hafner et al. 1994, taken from Open Tree of Life.

See <a href="http://tolweb.org/accessory/Cospeciation_of_Lice_and_Their_Hosts?acc_id=456">here </a> for an example.

The goal of the analysis is to construct two workflows:

Analysis "GopherLice A"

1. Start with the two trees and the interaction matrix.
2. Match the row and column names in the matrix to the tips of the two trees.
3. Create a tanglegram plot to infer patterns of cospeciation.

Analysis "GopherLice B"

1. Start with the interaction matrix.
2. Use the row and column names of the matrix to obtain phylogenetic trees from OpenTree.
3. Create a tanglegram plot to infer patterns of cospeciation.
